# Node CLI Generator

This is a simple CLI app that helps you generate a boilerplate for your Node.js CLI app. With this app, you can easily set up a basic structure for your CLI app and start developing your features right away.

## Installation

To install the app, run the following command:

```js
npm install -g n-create-cli

```

## Usage

To use the app, simply run the following command:

```vbnet
$ n-create-cli
$ ncli

$ n-create-cli <command> [option]

  help  Print help info

Options:
  -c, --clear    Clear the console Default: false
  -d, --debug    Print debug info Default: false
